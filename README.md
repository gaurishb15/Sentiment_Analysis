# Sentiment Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on building a custom Transformer model from scratch to perform sentiment classification without relying on pre-trained models. The model was trained on a dataset of social media sentences, with the objective of classifying each sentence as negative, neutral, or positive.

## Project Overview

- **Model**: Custom Transformer with multiple encoder layers and attention heads.
- **Objective**: Classify the sentiment of social media text into one of three categories: negative (-1), neutral (0), or positive (1).
- **Dataset**: Contains over 92,000 sentences in the training set and around 5,000 sentences in the test set.

## Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Converted sentences to lowercase and tokenized the text using Spacy.
- Lemmatized each token and generated part-of-speech (POS) tags.
- Applied padding/truncation to ensure each sentence had a consistent length.
- Converted lemmatized tokens to 100-dimensional embeddings using pre-trained GloVe embeddings.
- Used positional encodings and constructed an embedding layer for POS tags.

### 2. Model Architecture
- Transformer encoder with 4 layers, each containing 10 multi-head attention blocks.
- Reduced 3D tensor output to 2D using MaxPooling, MinPooling, and AveragePooling.
- A feed-forward neural network layer followed the transformer output to produce logits for each class.
- Used CrossEntropy as the loss function.

### 3. Training Process
- Optimized with Adam optimizer over 30 epochs.
- Batch size: 128, learning rate: \(7 \times 10^{-5}\).
- Training conducted on Google Colab, with each epoch taking approximately 25-30 minutes.

### 4. Evaluation
- The model achieved an F1 score of **0.658** on the validation set and **0.646** on the test set, demonstrating robust performance in sentiment classification.

## Results

The model performed well on both training and test sets, achieving competitive F1 scores without overfitting. However, longer sentences posed some challenges in accuracy.

| Phase       | F1 Score |
|-------------|----------|
| Validation  | 0.658    |
| Test        | 0.646    |

## Error Analysis
The model struggled with longer sentences due to the fixed maximum length, which limited the input to 64 tokens. Further improvements in handling sentence lengths could enhance the performance.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the power of Transformers in natural language processing tasks, particularly in sentiment analysis. Future improvements could involve refining the pre-processing pipeline by building a custom vocabulary and filtering stop words.
